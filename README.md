# MAPTY PROJECT

Mapty is a web application that allows users to record their workouts on a map. The app uses the Geolocation API to determine the user's location and display it on a map. Users can add different types of workouts such as running, cycling, swimming, and more. Each workout is displayed as a marker on the map with details such as duration, distance, and pace.

# FEATURES

1. Workout statistics: Users can view statistics such as total distance, duration, and pace for all their recorded workouts.
2. Displaying workouts: Users can view their recorded workouts on a map.
3. Workouts are saved to the browser's local storage so they persist across sessions.
4. Users can see their workout stats, such as distance and duration, in a sidebar.
